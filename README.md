I took the initiative to teach Java programming to 70+ students, helping them:
✔ Master exam-focused programs (Patterns, Arrays, Classes etc.)
✔ Build logical thinking and problem-solving skills
✔ Prepare for ICSE Board Practical Exams

**This repository will contain all the programs we covered in our sessions.(im a bit everywhere these days guys but within 1 week ill sure update this!)
Special thanks to:**

My students for their dedication.
My teacher who supported me along the journey
GitHub for hosting this open-source initiative.
